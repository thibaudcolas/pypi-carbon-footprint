# PyPI carbon footprint

Calculating the carbon footprint of Python packaging. At the scale of Python, there are a lot of opportunities to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its packaging story. But the first step is to understand and measure it!

## Why

Since PyPI infrastructure and Python packages are generally available for free, the environmental impact of this infrastructure is often overlooked. This is one of many aspects of building software with Python, and a lot of people would have an interest in understanding (and reducing) this carbon footprint:

- PyPA and the PSF.
- Package publishers who want to understand the footprint of their packages.
- Package consumers who want to quantify and reduce the footprint of their projects.

## Methodology

WIP

## How much

See the statistics on [The contents of PyPI, in numbers](https://py-code.org/stats) for starters, and:

> In the last year PyPI served 235.7 billion downloads for the 448,941 projects hosted there. This means that since the previous period, PyPI saw a 57% annual growth in download counts and bandwidth alike.
